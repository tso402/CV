## James Ault

I am an aspiring Junior Full Stack Web Developer in the process of transistioning from my previous role as an Oracle Functional Analyst. To achieve this I am currently attending the Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp after which I expect to be a fulling capable Web Developer. 

I am looking for a role where I can apply my new skills and continue to develop in a supportive and positive environment.

## Skills

During my most recent work as a Functional Analyst, I have lead the replatforming of an invoice matching system which required a number of skills to successfully deliver the project.

#### Problem Solving

As this was the first time a replatforming of this application had been attempted in our company I was required analyse and plan the required activities which frequently changed as new information came to light

#### Cross Team Working

Due to the nature of the replatform and the structure of our business I was required to quickly and effectively develop working relationships with teams ranging across the business from commercial to core IT and Infrastructure to allow delivery.

#### Taking The Inititive

Having originally not been assigned to the replatforming project, I quickly contacted and convinced the project sponser that I was the right person to deliver when I heard that the project had run into difficulty in its initial stages.

#### Taking Ownership

Once I had been assigned to the project I quickly determined the areas where my previous experience was relevent while continuing to research and develop my understanding any tasks that were outside my unsual work.
